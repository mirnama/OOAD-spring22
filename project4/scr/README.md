This is a game where there are four adventurers of different types travel around a temple to find treasure or fight 
monsters. 
There are three different types of Monsters: blinkers, orbiters, and seekers. The goal of the Adventurers is to find 
enough treasure or kill all the 12 monsters located around the temple.
In this Project we added multiple uses of design pattern. Our InerfaceCommand is a command Pattern, while we created a new factory pattern to great the game.
