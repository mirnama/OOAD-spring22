**PROJECT SUMMARY:**


For our project, we will create a Minecraft mod. We will create our mobs, treasure items, 
blocks, and drops within this mod. We will create two new 
mods which will live in lava lakes found in the Nether: 
a lava piranha and a lava dragon. Both mobs will have 
their attack, movement, and behavior. The lava piranha 
will school with other piranhas and jump out of the lava 
to attack the player when the player is near them. 
When killed, they will drop piranha scales, which 
can create special lava boots that allow the player 
to walk on lava. The lava dragon will sleep in lava and 
fly around the lake they spawn in. They will attack a player
by either diving into the player or shooting lava at the
player. The dragon will drop dragon teeth that can be
used to create a lava sword that can be used to weaken 
lava dragons and more easily kill them. Treasure items 
will spawn in chests at the bottom of lava lakes 
and can have dragon teeth, piranha scales, 
piranha boots, or the dragon tooth sword, as well 
as other nether mob loot and potions. Additionally, 
we will create lava lilies that will allow the player 
to stand on them and walk over the lava without the 
piranha boots.
